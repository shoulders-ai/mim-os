# Agent Sessions

CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Pi) are discovered apps, and
each launched agent is a first-class run ("agent session") with an Activity
row, a status lifecycle, persisted record + scrollback, and its own Work
surface. The scratch Terminal fixture is unchanged.

Product rationale: the terminal is never the activity — the agent session is.
The terminal is its rendering surface, the way ChatView renders a chat run.
Scratch shells keep zero ceremony; agent sessions get the full run grammar
(status, rename, archive, stop, history). Typing `claude` manually in a
scratch terminal tab is not promoted into a session.

## Concepts

| Concept | Maps to |
|---|---|
| Detected CLI agent | App (capability) launcher row in the Navigator Apps section |
| Agent session | Run: Activity row + `agent-session` Work entry |
| Scratch terminal | Unchanged fixed Terminal fixture, multi-tab panel, no Activity rows |

An agent session is the closest sibling of an app run: persisted record,
status lifecycle, boot-time stale reconciliation, close-guard participation,
archive/History membership. `agentSessions.ts` deliberately mirrors
`packageJobs.ts` shapes. Agents are **not** apps: no `app.status` rows,
no trust layers. Launcher visibility is **opt-in**: a row appears iff the
binary is installed and compatible on this machine **and** the user enabled the agent in
Settings → Apps, under Coding agents (the `enabledAgents` workspace setting,
default `[]` — detection alone never surfaces a launcher). The toggle gates
visibility only: it never installs or launches anything, and existing session
records, resume, Activity rows, and History are unaffected by toggling off.

## Main Process

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/main/agents/agentCatalog.ts` | Static catalog (`claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`, `pi`) + installation and compatibility detection. Pi is available only at version 0.76.0 or newer; detection runs `pi --version`, keeps incompatible installs visible, and returns an explanatory `compatibilityMessage`. `launchArgs`/`resumeArgs` provide lifecycle flags: Claude Code uses `--resume <id>`, Codex `resume <uuid>`, Gemini CLI `--session-file <path>`, and Pi receives the exact Mim id through `--session-id <id>` on both launch and resume. The Pi catalog entry declares its bundled extension resource, which is appended as a managed `--extension` argument after user flags. `cliSessionsDir` and `extractCodexSessionId` support file-diff discovery for the other CLIs. Pi session-control flags are reserved from custom arguments so callers cannot break identity. No Electron imports. |
| `src/main/agents/agentResources.ts` | Resolves external-agent assets from repository, built, and packaged roots. Packaged paths point to `app.asar.unpacked`, because Pi is a separate process and cannot read Electron's virtual archive. Missing optional resources return `null` so the underlying CLI can still launch. |
| `src/main/agents/agentSessions.ts` | Session lifecycle service (`createAgentSessions`): launch/resume/stop/list/get/rename/archive/delete, persistence, scrollback capture, event emission, `reconcileStaleSessions`, `activeSessionCount`. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI snapshot the CLI session directory before spawn and detect the new session file on first PTY output. Pi instead sets `cliSessionId` to the Mim session id before spawn, retains its custom `userArgs`, and loads the resolved bundled extension on launch and resume, making resume exact without filesystem discovery. System boundaries (pty spawn factory, token/port providers, resource resolver, emit, clock, id generator) are injected. |
| `src/main/agents/agentStatus.ts` | Pure runtime-status tracker over the pty output stream (see Status signals). Dependency-free, chunk-split-safe escape-sequence parser. Starts `idle`, ignores printable startup noise for 5 seconds, and derives settled `idle` after `done` or non-blocking `needs-input`. |
| `resources/pi/mim-extension.mjs` | First-party Pi extension. It authenticates directly to the desktop WebSocket with the session token, identifies calls as `pi`, reads the curated enabled tool catalog, registers those schemas with Pi, forwards calls with abort/timeout handling, and emits connection plus title-spinner lifecycle signals. Connection failure is non-fatal; `/mim-reconnect` retries without requiring a restart. |
| `src/main/tools/agents.ts` | Registers the `agent.*` tools over injected detect/sessions deps. |
| `src/main/pty.ts` | Shared `spawnPtyProcess` helper used by both `terminal.spawn` and agent sessions: every pty lives in the same instances map and forwards on the same `pty:output:<id>` / `pty:exit:<id>` channels. Renderer keystrokes use a fast-path `pty:input` IPC channel (`writePty`) that bypasses the tool registry; the `terminal.write` registry tool remains for programmatic use (bridge commands, AI/app callers). `terminal.spawn` opts scratch zsh shells into `ptyShellIntegration.ts` for keymap bindings; agent sessions do not opt in. `terminal.resize/kill` and renderer xterm attachment work uniformly on both scratch and agent ptys. |
| `src/main/closeGuard.ts` | `closeGuardDecision(dirtyTabCount, activeRunCount, activeAgentCount)` — third count produces "N running agent sessions" in the quit prompt. |
| `src/main/index.ts` | Wiring: `createAgentSessions({ getWorkspacePath, spawnPty: spawnPtyProcess, getMcpServerPort, createMcpToken, revokeMcpToken, emit })` (emit sends to the main window and broadcasts on the app server), `reconcileStaleSessions()` at boot, `registerAgentTools(tools, { sessions })`, agent count into the close guard. |
| `src/main/tools/archive.ts` | `archive.list` also returns `agentSessions` — archived records read straight from their files so the tool works without the live service (headless). |

Launched agent ptys receive `MIM_PORT` and a per-session `MIM_TOKEN` in their
environment. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI use those credentials through
their configured `mim mcp` bridge. Pi's bundled extension connects directly to
the same authenticated desktop tool surface, without an MCP subprocess or Pi
configuration change. The desktop still enforces the curated catalog and
Settings → Tools policy, and Pi calls carry `agent: "pi"` trace/audit
attribution plus the agent session id. Tokens are revoked on normal exit, stop,
or launch failure after token creation, which also closes the Pi adapter.

### Record and persistence

Records live at `.mim/agent-sessions/<sessionId>.json`, written via
`atomicWriteJson` on every transition. Scrollback is a sibling
`<sessionId>.scrollback` raw append file.

```ts
interface AgentSessionRecord {
  sessionId: string
  agentId: string
  title: string          // auto-assigned from task description (see below)
  command: string        // absolute binPath + args
  cwd: string            // workspace root
  status: 'running' | 'done' | 'error' | 'stopped' | 'interrupted'
  startedAt: string
  endedAt?: string
  exitCode?: number
  archived?: boolean
  titleHint?: string     // last OSC 0/1/2 title; persisted on change
  cliSessionId?: string  // native CLI id; for Pi this is the Mim session id
  userArgs?: string[]    // custom launch flags retained when exact resume needs them
}
```

### Auto-title

Sessions start with a default name ("Claude Code", "Codex 2", …). When the
agent begins working on a task, `attemptAutoTitle` fires and assigns a
descriptive title. The trigger is agent-agnostic:

**Primary trigger:** first `titleHint` change with a spinner prefix (Braille
or ✦). The trigger retries on each subsequent spinner-prefixed hint until a
non-trivial title is found (the first spinner often still carries just the
agent name, e.g. `⠂ Claude Code`, before the task description appears).

**Timer fallback:** 15 seconds after launch. Catches agents that never emit
spinner titles (some Gemini CLI versions).

Title extraction priority:
1. **titleHint** — strip indicator chars (✳, ◇, ✦, Braille), use if the
   cleaned text is a real task description (not the agent name, cwd basename,
   or generic status). Works for Claude Code.
2. **Scrollback heuristic** — strip ANSI from the scrollback file and search
   for prompt markers: `›` (Codex prompt lines with model/dir suffix stripped)
   or `>` with keystroke accumulation (Gemini). Works for Codex and Gemini CLI.
3. **LLM fallback** — if neither titleHint nor scrollback heuristic produces a
   result, the last 800 chars of cleaned scrollback are sent to
   `generateTaskLabel` (same cheap model call used for chat session labels).

Guards: auto-title fires at most once (`autoTitleAttempted` flag). Manual
rename blocks auto-title (`isDefaultAgentTitle` returns false). Resume does
not re-title (the flag is pre-set if the title is already non-default).

`AgentSessionRuntime` = record merged with live-only overlay fields for the
renderer: `ptyId` (attach xterm to the running pty), `runtimeStatus`
(`working` / `needs-input` / `done` / `idle`), and optionally `scrollback`. The overlay
is never persisted.

Status transitions:

- launch → persisted `running` with live `runtimeStatus: 'idle'`; launch and
  resume do not imply that the agent has begun a turn.
- pty exit → `stopped` if a stop was requested (`stopRequested` flag set before
  `handle.kill()`, classifying the exit regardless of its non-zero exit code),
  else `done` (exit 0) or `error` (non-zero).
- `stop` on a stale `running` record with no live pty → `stopped` directly.
- `reconcileStaleSessions()` at boot: any `running` record without a live pty
  becomes `stopped` (ptys die with the app, but the agent did not fail).
  Legacy `interrupted` records are still understood and rendered as stopped.
- `delete` throws while the session is running; for ended sessions it removes
  record + scrollback, and repeat deletes of an already-missing record are
  treated as already done.

Corrupt record files are quarantined, never poison list/get: renamed to
`<file>.corrupt` with a `console.error` (same convention as `sessions.ts`).

### Scrollback

Captured in the main process from the same `onData` hook that forwards pty
output, so it works even if the renderer never mounted the session. Byte-cap:
when the file exceeds 2 MiB (`SCROLLBACK_MAX_BYTES`) it is rewritten keeping
only the most recent 1 MiB (`SCROLLBACK_KEEP_BYTES`) — coarse front
truncation; xterm replay resynchronises on the next escape sequence.

### Status signals (`agentStatus.ts`)

`AgentRuntimeStatus = 'working' | 'needs-input' | 'done' | 'idle'`

Three signal layers, highest priority wins within a single `feed()` call:

**Layer 1: OSC 9;4;N; — terminal progress protocol** (Claude Code):
- `4;3;` (indeterminate progress) → `working`.
- `4;0;` (progress removed) → `done`.

**Layer 2: TUI title and spinner prefix** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Pi):
- The first plain title establishes that startup is ready → `idle`.
- Title gains a spinner prefix character → `working`.
- Title loses a spinner prefix character → `needs-input`.
- Spinner characters: Braille block (U+2800–U+28FF, animated frames) and
  ✦ U+2726 (Gemini CLI static working indicator). Detected by
  `isSpinnerPrefix()`.

**Layer 3: OSC 777 — desktop notification** (Claude Code):
- Any `OSC 777` payload → `needs-input`. Sets `needsInputIsBlocking` so
  the state does not degrade to idle (genuinely waiting on user approval).

**Fallback** (agents with none of the above):
- BEL (`\x07`) in plain text → `needs-input`.
- Printable output → `working` after the 5-second startup grace period. This
  preserves fallback detection without classifying boot banners as agent work.

Once any TUI signal (OSC 9, any title, or OSC 777) is seen,
`hasTuiSignals` is set and printable output no longer drives status.

**Idle derivation** (time-based, not signal-based):
- A new or resumed live session starts `idle` immediately.
- `done` + 5 s silence → `idle`.
- `needs-input` + 5 s silence → `idle`, **unless** `needsInputIsBlocking`
  (set by OSC 777 — the agent is genuinely waiting on user permission and
  should stay visible as "Input").

**Per-agent signal summary:**

| Agent | Working signal | Done signal | Needs-input signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | OSC 9;4;3; + Braille title | OSC 9;4;0; | Title ✳ (plan mode) / OSC 777 (permissions) |
| Codex | Braille title prefix | Title loses Braille | — (degrades to idle) |
| Gemini CLI | ✦ title prefix | ◇ title prefix | — (degrades to idle) |
| Pi | Bundled extension sets a Braille title prefix on `agent_start` | Title loses Braille on `agent_end` | Title loses Braille (degrades to idle) |

Pi's extension derives a compact title from `before_agent_start`, animates a
Braille-prefixed terminal title while the agent loop runs, and restores the
plain title when it settles. These use Pi's public lifecycle and `setTitle`
APIs, so the generic status tracker needs no Pi-specific escape protocol.
Printable output remains a fallback if the extension is absent or unavailable.

### Events

`agent:session-event` (sent to all windows + broadcast on the app
server) carries `{ type, session }` where `session` is the full
`AgentSessionRuntime`:

| Type | Emitted on |
|---|---|
| `session.started` | launch |
| `session.status` | runtime status or titleHint change |
| `session.exited` | pty exit (and stale-stop transition) |
| `session.changed` | rename, archive/restore |
| `session.deleted` | delete; carries the removed record so listeners prune by id |

The renderer upserts lifecycle/change events and prunes on `session.deleted`.
Do not treat delete as a generic change event, or a deleted record can be
reinserted into Activity with no backing `.json`/scrollback file.

### Tools

| Tool | Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.list` | read | Detected agents with absolute `binPath`; Pi also reports version and compatibility (login-shell resolution, cached) |
| `agent.launch` | mutate | Spawns the agent as an interactive pty in the workspace root; returns `{ session, ptyId }`. **User-only**: hard-denied to the `ai` actor before any approval or developer bypass (like `app.trust`) |
| `agent.resume` | mutate | Resumes an ended session with its native deterministic identity. **User-only**, same hard deny |
| `agent.stop` | mutate | Records the session as `stopped`. **User-only**, same hard deny |
| `agent.sessions.list` | read | Non-archived records merged with live runtime state |
| `agent.sessions.get` | read | One record; `scrollback: true` includes the captured text |
| `agent.sessions.rename` | mutate (ui/low) | Trimmed non-empty title |
| `agent.sessions.archive` | mutate (ui/low) | `archived: false` restores |
| `agent.sessions.delete` | mutate (ui/medium) | Removes record + scrollback; fails while running; repeat delete of an already-missing ended session is idempotent |

The **whole `agent.*` surface is denied to app actors** — agent sessions
run with the user's full shell authority. Policies live in `TOOL_POLICIES`
and the hard-deny branches in `src/main/security/gate.ts`; see
[security.md](security.md).

## Renderer

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/renderer/stores/agents.ts` | Detected-agent catalog mirror (`agent.list`); `enabledAgents` (installed ∩ compatible ∩ user-enabled) for launcher rows, `isEnabled`/`setEnabled` persisting the `enabledAgents` setting; error-tolerant refresh keeps the last known catalog |
| `src/renderer/stores/runs.ts` | `agentSessions` state + `agent-session` `NavigatorRun` kind. Status mapping: `running` + runtime overlay → `working`/`needs-input`/`idle`; `stopped` and legacy `interrupted` map to `stopped`; rename via `agent.sessions.rename` |
| `src/renderer/services/workbench/entries.ts` | `agentSessionWorkEntry(agentId, sessionId, title)` → id `work:agent-session:<sessionId>` (identity is the session id alone; agentId rides along for the view) |
| `src/renderer/services/workbench/hosts.ts` | `agent-session` Work host kind |
| `src/renderer/components/terminal/TerminalSurface.vue` | One xterm instance bound to one pty (live) **or** replaying a static scrollback string (replay). Extracted from `TerminalPanel.vue`, which keeps tabs, spawn ownership, and restart semantics for scratch terminals. Uses the profile-aware keybinding fallbacks in `terminalKeybindings.ts`; Pi has its own profile so Shift+Enter sends CSI-u newline rather than its Alt+Enter follow-up queue shortcut. |
| `src/renderer/components/agents/AgentSessionView.vue` | The `agent-session` Work surface: header with title/status/subtitle, Archive while running (stops first, then archives), live `TerminalSurface` bound to `ptyId` with the agent id as keybinding profile, ended banner (Exited / Failed (exit N) / Stopped) with Resume, plus Archive for stopped sessions, scrollback replay fetched once per ended session and re-fetched after a resumed session ends again, missing-record recovery state |
| `src/renderer/components/workbench/WorkHost.vue` | Mounts `AgentSessionView` for `agent-session` Work |
| `src/renderer/components/sidebar/ShellSidebar.vue` | Apps section: launcher rows for enabled agents (IconRobot) after app launchers, participating in `navigatorAppOrder` (plain ids; catalogs cannot collide). Launcher rows are pure launchers — every click spawns a new session, never "active". Activity: agent-session rows with status; context menu (`RunContextMenu.vue`) offers Stop only on live sessions and Delete only on ended ones; Archive stops live sessions before archiving; batch archive includes agent sessions, batch delete skips live ones |
| `src/renderer/App.vue` | Adapter: hydrates `agentsStore` + `runsStore.agentSessions` at boot and on workspace switch (`agent.list` + `agent.sessions.list`), subscribes `agent:session-event`, launch/open/stop/archive/delete handlers; archive and delete prune the matching Work history entry and fall back to Files Work when the pruned entry was active |
| `src/renderer/components/archive/ArchiveBrowser.vue` | History shows active and archived agent sessions; Open on an archived one un-archives it and reopens `agent-session` Work; Delete calls `agent.sessions.delete` |

## UX surfaces

- **Settings → Apps › Coding agents**: one row per catalog agent (name, `binPath` or
  "Not installed"), a toggle per available agent writing `enabledAgents`.
  Not-installed and incompatible agents have disabled toggles; version-gated
  agents show their version or a compatibility explanation. Each installed
  agent has a collapsed "Flags" disclosure with a free-text input for custom
  CLI flags (e.g. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--model o3`), persisted
  per workspace as `agentFlags: Record<string, string>` and appended to the
  launch command as `extraArgs`. Pi's row says "Mim tools built in" and does
  not offer MCP Connect/Disconnect: the extension loads automatically only in
  Mim-launched sessions. Its session-control flags and built-in extension
  injection are managed by Mim; user-supplied Pi extensions remain allowed.
- **App launcher rows**: one row per enabled available agent, agent icon,
  click = launch a new session and open its Work surface.
- **Activity rows**: one row per non-archived session, status dot/tag
  (`working`, `needs-input`, `idle`, `done`, `stopped`, `error`; legacy
  `interrupted` renders as `stopped`); click opens `work:agent-session:<id>`;
  inline rename; Stop (live only), Archive (stops live sessions first), Delete
  (ended only).
- **AgentSessionView**: live terminal while running with agent-specific
  keybinding profile and Archive in the header; ended banner + Resume, plus
  Archive for stopped sessions, with scrollback replay after; "Session not
  found" recovery if the record is gone.
- **History**: agent sessions appear next to chats and app runs,
  archived previews come from `archive.list` (`titleHint` as preview).
- **Close guard**: running sessions add "N running agent sessions" to the
  quit confirmation.
